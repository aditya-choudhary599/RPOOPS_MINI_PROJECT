## Part A: Data Collection from Companies

In Part A of our groundbreaking Student Internship App, we have implemented an impressive data collection system that seamlessly gathers crucial internship information directly from visiting companies on campus. This cutting-edge process ensures a seamless flow of data, which is securely stored in Firebase, our robust backend platform renowned for its scalability and real-time database capabilities. By leveraging Firebase's powerful infrastructure, we guarantee the reliability and security of the collected data, enabling students to access up-to-date and accurate information about internship opportunities. With this comprehensive and efficient data collection mechanism, our app empowers students to make informed decisions, paving the way for successful and fulfilling career paths.
## Part B: Simulated Real-Time Experience 

In Part B of our Student Internship App, we have simulated real-time data by creating a data scheme that closely aligns with the information collected from companies. This allows us to provide students with a realistic experience and meaningful analysis. Although the data is generated internally, our app's analysis capabilities remain fully functional, providing students with valuable insights and recommendations. Our aim is to integrate real-time data from companies in the future to enhance the authenticity and accuracy of the internship information. Overall, Part B showcases our app's functionality and its potential to empower students in their internship decision-making process.
## Part C: Data Analysis and Insights

In Part C of our Student Internship App, we harness the power of Pandas to analyze the data collected from companies stored in Firebase. With secure authentication through Firebase, our app caters specifically to Second-year Computer Engineering students from the prestigious College of Engineering Pune. We provide insightful visualizations, domain analysis, and personalized recommendations based on students' CGPA and interest. Additionally, our meticulously curated roadmaps offer a comprehensive guide to master popular programming languages, ensuring students are well-prepared for internship opportunities. Experience a data-driven journey towards internship success with our Student Internship App.
